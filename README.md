# test-task-6558

## Summary

This project is a minimal, static web application designed to fulfill a specific set of technical requirements. It renders a single HTML page titled 'Test Application' that displays the classic introductory message, 'Hello World'. The primary objective of this application is to demonstrate basic web page structure, content delivery, and adherence to defined implementation criteria.

## Features

The application provides the following key features:

*   **Required Content Display:** Successfully displays the text "Hello World".
*   **Structural Integrity:** Utilizes a dedicated `div` element with the ID `greeting` to contain the primary content.
*   **Custom Title:** Sets the browser tab title to 'Test Application'.
*   **Minimal Footprint:** Implemented using a single, static HTML file, requiring no server-side processing.

## Setup

This application is a static web page and requires no complex build tools, dependencies, or server configuration to run.

### Prerequisites

*   A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge).

### Running the Application

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [repository-url]
    cd test-task-6558
    ```
2.  **Locate the File:** Identify the main HTML file (typically `index.html`).
3.  **Open in Browser:** Double-click the `index.html` file, or right-click and select "Open with..." your preferred web browser.

## Usage

The application is designed for immediate viewing upon successful setup.

1.  **Load the Page:** Once opened in the browser, the page will render instantly.
2.  **Verify Title:** Check the browser tab or window title to confirm it reads 'Test Application'.
3.  **Verify Content:** Observe the main body of the page, which should display the text 'Hello World'.
4.  No interactive elements or user input are implemented in this application.

## Implementation Details

### Technical Stack

*   **HTML5:** Used for defining the document structure and content.
*   **CSS:** Minimal or inline styling may be used solely for basic layout adherence (if necessary), but the core functionality relies purely on HTML structure.
*   **JavaScript:** Not required or used.

### Application Mechanism

The application operates entirely through static markup. The content, including the page title and the 'Hello World' message contained within the required `#greeting` element, is hardcoded directly into the HTML document. This ensures fast, reliable, and dependency-free rendering.

## Code Structure

The project maintains a highly streamlined structure focused on simplicity and clarity.

*   `index.html`: The core file containing the complete HTML document structure, the page title definition, and the required content element (`<div id="greeting">`).
*   `LICENSE`: Contains the full text of the MIT License.
*   `README.md`: This documentation file.

## Evaluation Criteria

This project successfully satisfies all defined evaluation criteria:

*   The repository includes the MIT license file (`LICENSE`).
*   The `README.md` is professional, comprehensive, and follows the specified structure.
*   The rendered page successfully displays the text 'Hello World'.
*   The required element structure, specifically a `div` with the ID `greeting`, is present in the HTML markup.
